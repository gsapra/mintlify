How to create docs for your products

**Install Mintlify CLI**
npm i -g mintlify
**Install dependencies**
npm install
**Start development server**
mintlify dev


This gives you a basic documentation structure that you can build upon. The key differences from the Future AGI documentation are:

1. Simplified navigation structure
2. Basic color scheme (which you can customize)
3. Fewer sections initially
4. Basic example setup

You can expand this by:
1. Adding more documentation sections
2. Customizing the theme colors
3. Adding more examples
4. Including API reference documentation
5. Adding custom components

Remember to replace placeholders like:
- `yourusername/your-repo` with your actual GitHub repository
- `your-app-url.com` with your actual application URL
- Create your own logo files in the `logo/` directory

Would you like me to provide more specific examples for any of these sections?
